    <h3 className="text-[23px] font-semibold text-black">Spirulina is?</h3>
    <p>Spirulina is a blue green algae (Arthrospira platensis) known for its numerous health benefits. It is deemed as the most beneficial "SuperFood" for any gender and age.</p>

    <h3 className="text-[23px] font-semibold text-black">Benefits of Spirulina....</h3>
    <p>
      Spirulina contains a rich supply of many important nutrients, including beta carotene, Vitamins A, C, E, B complex, Carbohydrates, Iron, Protein, Antioxidants, Fatty acids, and minerals like Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium and Zinc. Thus, Spirulina with its countless nutritional benefits supports good health, gently strengthens the body and improves immunity.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-[23px] font-semibold text-black">Emerging Business Opportunities</h3>
    <p>
      Our nutritional needs are not being met satisfactorily, due to inadequate nutrient content in modern diet, and also due to lifestyle related disorders. This has adverse effects onto the human body. This is where Super Foods come into the picture and SPIRULINA offers a promising market in the health industry. That's the reason, many multinational companies are entering into the Spirulina market and demand is going high day by day.
